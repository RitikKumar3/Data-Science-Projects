## Introduction
This repository contains hands-on projects that cover a wide range of data science and machine learning concepts. Whether you're a beginner looking to start your journey or an intermediate practitioner seeking practical exercises, you'll find projects that cater to different skill levels.

## Projects
- [Project 1: Flight Booking Price Prediction](project1/)
  - Our objective is to analyze the flight booking dataset obtained from a platform which is used to book flight tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers. Here we apply EDA, statistical methods and Machine learning algorithms in order to get meaningful information from it.

- [Project 2: Classification -Credit Score](project2/)
  - Objective:To build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts. Given a person’s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.
   
- [Project 3: Capstone Project(Netflix)](project3/)
  - Objective: We will be creating one such Recommendation Engine from the ground-up, where every single user, based on there area of interest and ratings, would be recommended a list of movies that are best suited for them.
   
- [Project 4: Telecom Customer Churn(Logistic Regression)](project4/)
  - Objective: You are the data scientist at a telecom company named “Neo” whose customers are churning out to its competitors. You have to analyze the data of your company and find insights and stop your customers from churning out to other telecom companies.

- [Project 5: Bio-Signal Analysis for Smoking](project5/)
  - Objective: You are working as a data scientist in a global company. Over the years, the company has collected details and gathered a lot of information about individuals. The management wants to build an intelligent system from the data to determine the presence or absence of smoking in a person through bio-signals. Given a person’s information, build a machine learning model that can classify the presence or absence of smoking.

- [Project 6: Heart Disease Prediction](project6/)
  - Objective: In this project, we delve into a dataset encapsulating various health metrics from heart patients, including age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease. Given the grave implications of missing a positive diagnosis, our primary emphasis is on ensuring that the model identifies all potential patients, making recall for the positive class a crucial metric.

- [Project 7: Capstone Project Walmart & Online Retail](project7/)
 - Objective:
  - Problem Statement 1: Capstone Project - Walmart
A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing issues in managing the inventory - to match the demand with respect to supply. You are a data scientist, who has to come up with useful insights using the data and make prediction models to forecast the sales for X number of months/years.

     - Using the above data, come up with useful insights that can be used by each of the stores to improve in various areas.
     - Forecast the sales for each store for the next 12 weeks.
      
  - Problem Statement 2: Capstone Project - OnlineRetail
An online retail store is trying to understand the various customer purchase patterns for their firm, you are required to give enough evidence based insights to provide the same.

    - Using the data, find useful insights about the customer purchasing history that can be an added advantage for the online retailer.
    - Segment the customers based on their purchasing behavior.
