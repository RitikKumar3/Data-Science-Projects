## Introduction
This repository contains hands-on projects that cover a wide range of data science and machine learning concepts. Whether you're a beginner looking to start your journey or an intermediate practitioner seeking practical exercises, you'll find projects that cater to different skill levels.

## Projects
- [Project 1: Flight Booking Price Prediction](project1/)
  - Our objective is to analyze the flight booking dataset obtained from a platform which is used to book flight tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers. Here we apply EDA, statistical methods and Machine learning algorithms in order to get meaningful information from it.

- [Project 2: Classification -Credit Score](project2/)
  - Objective:To build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts. Given a person’s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.
     
- [Project 3: Telecom Customer Churn(Logistic Regression)](project3/)
  - Objective: You are the data scientist at a telecom company named “Neo” whose customers are churning out to its competitors. You have to analyze the data of your company and find insights and stop your customers from churning out to other telecom companies.

- [Project 4: Bio-Signal Analysis for Smoking](project4/)
  - Objective: You are working as a data scientist in a global company. Over the years, the company has collected details and gathered a lot of information about individuals. The management wants to build an intelligent system from the data to determine the presence or absence of smoking in a person through bio-signals. Given a person’s information, build a machine learning model that can classify the presence or absence of smoking.

- [Project 5: Heart Disease Prediction](project5/)
  - Objective: In this project, we delve into a dataset encapsulating various health metrics from heart patients, including age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease. Given the grave implications of missing a positive diagnosis, our primary emphasis is on ensuring that the model identifies all potential patients, making recall for the positive class a crucial metric.

- [Project 6: Wine Quality Prediction](project6/)
  - Objective: Predict whether a wine is of good or bad quality based on factors such as chemical composition and other relevant attributes. This objective aims to provide an objective measure of wine quality that helps stakeholders differentiate between wines that meet high-quality standards and those that fall below expectations.Measure the accuracy and consistency of the model’s predictions across different wines. This metric indicates the reliability of the model in consistently assessing wine quality and can help ensure that wines are classified correctly.

- [Project 7: Super Market Price Prediction](project7/)
  - Objective: The dataset comprises store attributes like area, items, daily customers, and sales. Machine learning aims to predict sales, segment customers, detect anomalies, and optimize store operations for enhanced profitability.

- [Project 8: Human Resource Analysis](project8/)
  - Objective: The objective of this study is to employ HR Analytics methodologies to identify and explore people-related trends that are directly linked to attrition. By closely examining the data, we seek to unravel the intricate factors associated with attrition rates, such as employee demographics, performance indicators, job satisfaction levels, and potential predictors of voluntary employee departures.
