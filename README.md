## Introduction
This repository contains hands-on projects that cover a wide range of data science and machine learning concepts. Whether you're a beginner looking to start your journey or an intermediate practitioner seeking practical exercises, you'll find projects that cater to different skill levels.

## Projects
- [Project 1: Flight Booking Price Prediction](project1/)
  - Our objective is to analyze the flight booking dataset obtained from a platform which is used to book flight tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers. Here we apply EDA, statistical methods and Machine learning algorithms in order to get meaningful information from it.

- [Project 2: Classification -Credit Score](project2/)
  - Objective:To build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts. Given a person’s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.
   
- [Project 3: Capstone Project(Netflix)](project3/)
  - Objective: We will be creating one such Recommendation Engine from the ground-up, where every single user, based on there area of interest and ratings, would be recommended a list of movies that are best suited for them.
   
- [Project 4: Telecom Customer Churn(Logistic Regression)](project4/)
  - Objective: You are the data scientist at a telecom company named “Neo” whose customers are churning out to its competitors. You have to analyze the data of your company and find insights and stop your customers from churning out to other telecom companies.
